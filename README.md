# leaflet-challenge

https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html I used this site to help me with the color schemes while creating the map and legend 

I used ChatGPT to help me figure out how to create a legend. I kept getting an error on my html page. The points were showing up but no legend so I used ChatGPT in getting the correct code

https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_table_borders.asp was used in formatting the table 

https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/ to help with leaflet and creating a map 

AskBCS in helping me troubleshoot the map I had created. Nothing would appear in the html page, so I had to get help from AskBCS
